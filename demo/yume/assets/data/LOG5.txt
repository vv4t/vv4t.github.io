I encountered an intelligent humanoid machine. When I first saw it, it was in the process of 
using taken parts from another of its kind to upgrade itself. Their kind is extremely individualistic,
but can live for incredibly long periods of time.

It told me that the creators of the city have since disappeared.

If it is to be believed, there are no governing bodies on the planet to negotiate with.
