        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>
          Borrasca is a top-down adventure game for my school multimedia game design
          project. The game is a top-down adventure game of a miner battling his way
          through a cave of monsters who are vulnerable to light.

          The game was written in C++ is attempts to replicate the graphics of Realm of
          the Mad God to a moderate degree of success.

          However, because of time restrictions, the game was not finished.
