        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>
          UTUUJIN is a pixel adventure puzzle game I made for my Year 11
          Software Development and Design Major Project. Because I was limited
          to using Visual Basic, the rendering was built from the ground up
          using raster graphics.<br>
          <br>
          The design was heavily inspired by <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yume_Nikki">Yume Nikki</a>,
          another pixel adventure game, attempting to recreate its vibe through
          the music and aesthetic. Overall, I think it was quite successful,
          though short and linear, as a game, it's the most thoroughly made out
          of my projects so far.
