        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>
          NUKO is a first person multiplayer shooter which I wrote for my HSC
          Software Development and Design Year 12 Major Project. The game is
          written in C and SDL2 and compiled with emscripten in to WASM for a
          browser experience.<br>
          <br>
          For this project, I wanted to compile all the game engine development
          knowledge I had accumulated throughout the past few years into a
          single final project. The final project builds all aspects: physics,
          rendering and networking from the ground up without any external
          libraries other than SDL2.
          <br>
          Particularly, this project had a focus on developing a seamless real
          time multiplayer experience with an emphasis on server-side trust.
          The project implementsm ethods of client-side prediction and
          interpolation of the game state to provide a smooth experience over a
          delayed internet connection.
