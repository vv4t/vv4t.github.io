deviates from any reference materials so mostly just making shit up tbbh

- "how does form affect identity"
  - how has form defined their mortality and how has this affected their perception of self
  - for each character we examine what form they have, how their mortality is
    shaped by this, how they view their self/ego and its consequences

- the net (lore)
  - the city is essentially the infrastructure hosting/running the net
  - people used to upload their conscious to the net
  - one must relinquish their individuality to become part of it
  - eventually became a collective conscious
  - the huge expanse of conscious forms a singular conscious
  - separated from the real world now
  - originally humans chose to upload themselves to the net
  - or otherwise stay in the real world and adminster control over the city via the net using a special gene
  - after a virus, humans no longer have the gene to control the city
  - the nature of the net, it became a bystander isolated from the real world and let city go into chaos
  - ego and form
    - a mechanical immortal form but with no sense of self
    - the interconnectedness of everyone means that there is no individuality
    - everyone simply understands everyone else and on a mass level this evens any sense of desire, individuality or ego
