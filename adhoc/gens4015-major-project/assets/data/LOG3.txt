I have had my first intelligent encounter on this structure. The creature was
of a biological nature and was initially a disjoint swarm of creatuers. Though
each individual creature had no recognisable intellect, upon my presence they
seemed to have amalgamated. In this form, the creatures took on a form of
intelligence and identified as a single being. It is a biological wonder that
such creature has adapted in this harsh environment and is still able to
maintain some form of intelligence, immortality of the self even.

As for information, the creature has given me a vague idea of what this place
might, or might have been. It seems to be a "city". There was mentions of "the
net". And in examining the EM signal at proximity. Is it possible that built
into this structure itself, is this "the net"?
