      <h1 id="on-the-creation-of-nuko---part-i---collision">On the Creation of NUKO - Part I - COLLISION</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>NUKO is the cumulative product of the past four or so years of studying game
engine development. It compiles all my knowledge of rendering, physics and
networking <del>not sound (yet)</del> into a single wholly completed project.</p>

<p>Perhaps the catalyst for me choosing to pursue this project was finally being able to
write physics in 3D.</p>

<p>Up until then, I had written several demos including 3D graphics using OpenGL,
however, I could only noclip around the geometry I had loaded in. Other games
using 3D graphics I had developed, such as <em>Aechmea</em>, hid behind the facade of
3D graphics while actually operating on 2D logic such as the use of a flat grid
for tile collision. As a result, the maps were limited to being flat and blocky.</p>

<p>However, a small demo I had been working on a few months prior aimed to solve
this.</p>

<h2 id="separating-axis-theorem-and-binary-space-partitioning">SEPARATING AXIS THEOREM AND BINARY SPACE PARTITIONING</h2>

<p>The inception of what would become NUKO can actually be traced back to almost
two years before its actual creation. It was essentially born out of attempting
to solve collision in a 3D environment.</p>

<p>NUKO began as a project to test if I could combine Separating Axis Theorem (SAT)
and Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) to create an efficient collision algorithm.</p>

<p>The idea spawned from trying to implement DOOM&#8217;s binary space partitioning
rendering algorithm where space was divided into partitions stored in a binary
tree.</p>

<p>A map in DOOM was essentially composed of lines or &#8220;segments&#8221;. These were
abstracted into planes or &#8220;linedefs&#8221;, essentially the line but stretching
infinitely. The space was then split in half by a plane into the space in front
of it and the space behind it. This could then be represented in a binary tree
where each node is a plane and its two children are the front and back space.</p>

<p>A tree traversal, such as checking the player&#8217;s position, would involve
beginning with a node, checking if the position was behind or above the
node&#8217;s plane and the corresponding child node would be walked into. This was
applied recursively until an leaf node was reached.</p>

<p>It suddenly clicked to me that, performing a series of plane tests on a position
to determine if it occupied a certain space, was essentially collision.</p>

<p>A general convex hull collision algorithm, Separating Axis Theorem, used a
similar principle &#8211; that between two convex hulls, there would be a plane of
separation if they were not colliding, i.e. if the closest vertex to the shape
(position) was in front of any of the hull&#8217;s planes, it was not colliding.</p>

<p>With this general idea, I began writing up some of the first iterations of NUKO.</p>

<h2 id="generating-a-bsp">GENERATING A BSP</h2>

<p>Before any collision algorithm could be written however, the BSP itself would
have be generated. This required an algorithm which could turn 3D geometry into
a BSP.</p>

<p>Out of all things, this was the most problematic and would come
to haunt me throughout its creation.</p>
