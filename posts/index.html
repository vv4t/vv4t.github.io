            <h2>On the creation of NUKO; my game engine development journey thus far - 04.09.2022</h2>
            <p>
              For this project, I wanted to compile all the game engine technology I had learnt throughout the past years into a single game. Because of this, the game was written from the ground up including physics, rendering and networking. The only libraries used were SDL2 and OpenGL.
